# APICallerTest

In order to understand how to make GET and POST calls to API, operate with response and pass body I crated this very simple project.

Inside I do few things
- Test if the API connection works properly
- Make GET call to receive response, deserialize response from JSON to object, print specific value
- Make POST call with body, receive response, print response (could be expanded to deseralize response from JSON to object, but it's done in GET part so no added learning value)
